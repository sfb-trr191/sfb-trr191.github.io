Within the master thesis a framework for the analysis of plane fields will be developed. Using a particle simulation, these fields will be visualized and afterwards examined for properties. Due to the large-scale computational problem, the calculations are performed on the graphics card using CUDA. The introduction of a new approach should provide further insights into the behavior of general vector fields. In this technique particles are shifted in the direction of random vectors on the tangent planes. Using a uniform distribution, particle structures have been created which were analyzed with probabilistic methods. Therefore, individual particle paths, particle density and the behavior of the particles using different integration methods were considered in more detail. The degree of freedom of the particle's movement is restricted by the motion scheme and different results were obtained due to the influence of random distribution and curvatures in the plane field. In doing so, deviations in the particle paths were detected. However, in order to evaluate the effect of the individual trajectories on the entire particle structure it needs to be considered as a total collective. Inspired by Monte-Carlo simulations the density of the particles at different positions in the plane field could be visualized. At this point, further methods have to be developed in the future for a better investigation of the differences in the particle density.
