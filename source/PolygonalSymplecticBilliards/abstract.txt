We are investigating the discrete dynamical system of symplectic billiards in the planar case of polygons. We are looking at the problems from a two-table perspective that subsumes the single table perspective. The project has involved a theoretical and a programming component. The theoretical component included stating and proving new theorems concerning the existence of periodic orbits and finding interesting examples. Informative visualizations through animations on an interactive window are result of the programming component.
