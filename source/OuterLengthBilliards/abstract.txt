To investigate the discrete dynamical system of outer length billiards in the planar case of polygons, we developed an interactive program to simulate the system. This software is capable of simulating multiple trajectories simultaneously within a single polygon. To differentiate between these trajectories, each can be assigned a different color. Furthermore, we utilize fragment shader programs that can be applied at runtime to visualize the discontinuity set of the system.
