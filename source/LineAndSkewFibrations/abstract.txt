In the realm of geometric analysis, skew fibrations—where non-parallel fibers within a line fibration do not intersect—play a crucial role. This project focuses on extracting subregions from discretized data in R³ containing such skew fibrations. We propose a methodology combining computational geometry and data visualization techniques to identify and visualize these skew fibrations amidst complex spatial structures. Through experimentation, we validate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately detecting skew fibrations and discuss potential applications across computational geometry and scientific visualization domains.
