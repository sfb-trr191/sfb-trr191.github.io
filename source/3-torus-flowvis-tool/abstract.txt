This web-based tool allows interactive flow visualization on Riemannian 3-manifolds in quotient-space and implicit formulation with a focus on accessibility, flexibility, and provenance. The current state is stored as URL and can be embedded into PDFs, allowing easy reproducibility, explorability, and collaboration.
