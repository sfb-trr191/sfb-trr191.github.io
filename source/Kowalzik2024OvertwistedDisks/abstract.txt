This thesis is about the numerical extraction of overtwisted disks in contact structures
in RÂ³. Overtwisted disks play an important role in contact geometry as their
existence distinguishes two different kinds of contact structures, namely the overtwisted
and the tight contact structures. On the other side they are also useful for
the visualization of overtwisted contact structures, especially in combination with
further extracted data, like the region of the contact structure that consists of overtwisted
disk center points.

We will define and extract pairs of distinguished tangential directions in the
plane field that are extremal with respect to certainmeasures. These directions then
serve as a strategy to integrate Legendrian curves on a contact structure which are
used for the extraction of overtwisted disks. The associated anisotropy fields measure
the quality of the extracted vector fields and will be also used to determine
possible center points of overtwisted disks. As the nonintegrability is a key aspect
of contact structures, we will derive a formula to efficiently calculate a measure for
the local nonintegrability of a plane fields.
